        <h1>Hi! My name is Trevor Carver.</h1>
        <h3>I am currently pursuing a degree in Web Design and Development as Lewis Clark State College.<br>
        During my time here I have come to experience the many different aspects of Design and Development. <br>
        I am familiar with both sides but I do prefer the Development side. I have covered many different languages including: C#, Javascript, HTML/CSS, PHP, JSON, and XML. 
        <br>I have also been working with SQL databases and have a pretty good understanding of them.
        <br>To figure out what I know let's start from the beginning with HTML,   
        </h3>
        <p>This <a href = "http://bonsai.lcsc.edu/tacarver/CITPT111/Final/"><strong>link</strong></a> will take you to my first "major" website that I made.
            <br>At first glance it doesn't seem like much I know, but I thought it was good at the time. 
            I'm sure you can tell that I'm not the best at CSS. I understand the HTML but the CSS has never been my specialty. 
            
            
        </p>
        <img src = "images/Final111.png"  height = 400px width = 400px>
        <p>On that note we will move on to more of the programming side of things.
            <br>
            This <a href = "http://bonsai.lcsc.edu/tacarver/CITPT213/Final/"><strong>link</strong></a> will take you to one of my more recent projects.
            <br>It may look simple(at least design wise), but it actually has quite a bit behind it. All the reviews the user enters are stored into a database along with their username.
            <br>The database then takes that newly stored review and places it back onto the page. 
            
        </p>
        <img src = "images/CITPT213GameReview.jpg" height = 400px width = 600px>
        <p>The final thing(for now) that I have to share is my Reminder App. It is not hosted on a web server so instead I will be sharing images.
            <br>
            We see in the first image what the home page looks like.<br>

            <img src = "images/page1.png">
            <br>
            The second image shows what the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pages show the 2nd, 3rd, and final steps(in order).
            <br>
            <img src= "images/page2.png">
            <br>
            <img src= "images/page3.png">
            <br>
            <img src= "images/page4.png">
            <br>
            In hindsight it would have been better to place everything on one page, and that's what I plan to eventually do. It's a work in progress though and I do like how it turned out.
